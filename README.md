# Channel-Coefficient-Estimation-using-Confidence-Intervals
  This project explores the use of confidence intervals to quantify the accuracy of channel estimation for a wired, digital communications system using Monte Carlo Simulation. The system sends a sequence of known (+1) and unknown (+1 or -1) symbols. After appropriate filtering and sampling, the real-valued received sample for the ith symbol period can be modeled as 𝑋𝑖 = 𝐶+𝑁𝑖, where 𝐶 is the channel coefficient to be estimated (deterministic, real-valued) and 𝑁𝑖 is a sequence of i.i.d. Gaussian noise r.v.’s with zero mean and variance 𝜎𝑁2. While performing channel estimation, it is assumed that there are ‘n’ data points received at the receiver’s end and the channel coefficient estimate is needed for demodulation.
