# Channel-CoeffIcient-Estimation-using-Confidence-Intervals
This project explores the use of confidence intervals to quantify the accuracy of channel estimation for a wired, digital communications system. The system sends a sequence of known (+1) and unknown (+1 or -1) symbols. After appropriate filtering and sampling, the real-valued received sample for the ith symbol period can be modeled as 𝑋𝑖=𝐶+𝑁𝑖, where 𝐶 is the channel coefficient to be estimated (deterministic, real-valued) and 𝑁𝑖 is a sequence of i.i.d. Gaussian noise r.v.’s with zero mean and variance 𝜎𝑁2. It is assumed that there are n pilot symbols, producing n received samples available for channel estimation. A channel coefficient estimate is needed to recover the set of unknown symbols (demodulation).
